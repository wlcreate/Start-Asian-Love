After the increase of attacks on Asian Americans since COVID-19, the Atlanta Spa Shootings that occurred on March 16, 2021 and rise of the Stop Asian Hate movement, Emmanuel Jose and Waverley Leung came together to work on Start Asian Love as our own way to take action. 

Start Asian Love is a safe space that educates and consolidates resources related to Asian racism, Asian American history, and the Stop Asian Hate movement. Through these resources we hope to raise awareness and encourage you to join the fight and support Asian Americans.
